**Celebrity Lookalike App**

This app was created using solely python. It uses OpenCV to process uploaded images to find the user's face.
It then vectorizes the face with the pretrained FaceNet model and compares it to a database of existing face vectors,
returning the images and names most similar.

It is hosted through streamlit community cloud and can be accessed here
